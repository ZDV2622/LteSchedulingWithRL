# LteSchedulingWithRL

Description
-----------------------------------

This code can be used to estimate resource scheduling efficiency in LTE system.
It lets to compare three algorithms: RoundRobin, BestCQI and RLAgent.
This model lets to investigate, how diffrent RL technique(DQN, PG) can be applied to solve optimization problem.
